              <ul>
                  <li>
                      1 - pound of your favorite quick cooking pasta. Angel hair, rice noodles or soba are all good choices.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1 - medium onion sliced into 1/4" slices
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      8 - cloves of garlic peeled and smashed
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      2 - salmon fillets thawed
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1 - pound pre-cooked shrimp thawed
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1 - stick of unsalted butter
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      4 - Tbsp of your favorite Italian seasoning
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1 - Tbsp of salt
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      3 - 2'X2' squares of aluminum foil
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1 - quart of treated water
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1 - lemon cut in half
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p><h3>The Salmon</h3></p>
              <p>In the center of a 2'X2' square of aluminum foil combine the following in this order:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      1/2 of the onion slices\(placing the onion slices down 1st not only provides flavor, but also provides a buffer between the salmon and the fire to prevent burning.)\
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      A salmon fillet
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1 - Tbsp of your favorite Italian seasoning
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1/4 of the butter
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Bring 2 sides of the foil together and roll them together to about 2" above the salmon. Roll each of the other sides toward the center to about 2" from the salmon. You want to leave this 2' space around the salmon so it can steam in the foil pouch.</p>
              <p>Repeat this for the other fillet and set them aside while you prepare the shrimp.</p>
              
              <p><h3>The Shrimp</h3></p>
              <p>In the center of a 2'X2' square of aluminum foil combine the following:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      The shrimp
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      1/2 of the butter
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      2 - Tbsp of your favorite Italian seasoning
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Bring 2 sides of the foil together and roll them together to about 2" above the shrimp. Roll each of the other sides toward the center to about 2" from the shrimp. You want to leave this 2' space around the shrimp so it can steam in the foil pouch.</p>
              
              <p><h3>Let's Cook</h3></p>
              <p>Place the salmon pouches over hot coals for about 10 minutes making sure the pouches are not over direct flame or the salmon will cook too fast and burn.</p>
              <p>After 10 minutes add the shimp to the fire. Remember. The shrimp are already cooked. All you are doing is thawing the shrimp and melting the butter.</p>
              <p>After you add the shrimp to the fire, get you're water boiling over your gas stove. When the water is boiling add your salt and pasta. Cook the pasta until al dente.</p>
              <p>Check the salmon and shrimp. The shrimp are done when they are warm through. The salmon is done when it flakes with a fork.</p>
              
              <p><h3>Serve It Up</h3></p>
              <p>Using tongs, add some pasta to the plate. Don't worry about draining it. The salty water will combine with the butter to create a wonderful sauce.</p>
              <p>Top the pasta with some of the shrimp and a salmon fillet.</p>
              <p>Squeeze some fresh lemon over the plate and dig in!</p>
